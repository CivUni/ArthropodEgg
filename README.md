# ArthropodEgg
## Forked by dkf-lab for CivUniverse
For when you want to do something useful with crappy enchants.

This mod gives a small chance for weapons enchanted with "Bane of Arthropods"
to add a spawn egg to a monster's loot pool.  The spawn egg is the same type
as the monster killed.  

Default Parameters are as follows:
3% drop rate per level of "Bane of Arthropods" on a weapon or "Smite"
2% drop rate per level of "Looting" on a weapon.  Does not function without also having "Bane of Arthropods"or "Smite"
Works on all passive mobs except golems.  (snow and iron).
Will remove the loot pool from creatures that are turned into eggs. (configurable)

Smite drops the head of the mob rather than the spawn egg.
Only a small amount of mobs are supported, though it is very easy to add more to code.
