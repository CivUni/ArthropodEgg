ArthropodEgg

For when you want to do something useful with crappy enchants.

This mod gives a small chance for weapons enchanted with "Bane of Arthropods"
to add a spawn egg to a monster's loot pool.  The spawn egg is the same type
as the monster killed.  The percent chance is currently hardcoded to 5%
per level of enchantment, to a maximum normal chance of 25%.
